# Text-Recognition

Text recognition involves extracting meaningful information or patterns from textual data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a specific form of text recognition that deals with converting images of text into machine-encoded text. If you're interested in text recognition using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and deep learning, you might consider using a pre-trained model or building your own.
